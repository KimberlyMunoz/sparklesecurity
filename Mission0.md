# Sparkle Security Mission 0

This mission is intended to help you find and set up a vulnerable web
application to play with.

# Introduction

Agent Sparkle, you have been recruited as a security expert to use your skills

# Sparkle Opsec

Before we start downloading vulnerable applications for training, Agent
Sparkle, you need to know a bit about OpSec.  "OpSec" is short-form for
"operational security."  Wikipedia defines it like this:

"Operations security (OPSEC) is a term originating in U.S. military jargon, as
a process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions
can be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained by
adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes
selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly
critical information."
