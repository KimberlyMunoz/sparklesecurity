Sparkling training missions for web security.

These are being created as part of the ChickTech Code For Good Hackathon,
as an idea for more tutorials to teach about security, since it is an
essential part of software development.

## Resources

These training missions make use of some well-known vulnerable web
applications. They have other tutorials attached, but they didn't have
enough sparkles.
